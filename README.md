# 🎬 Movie Streaming Platform (Project Attempt)

## ⚠️ Project Status: Discontinued

This project was **discontinued** because it failed to achieve its main objective: providing a **free movie streaming service**, due to the **absence of a suitable and legal public API**.

### ❌ Reason for Failure
After extensive research, the available APIs were found to provide only:
- Movie metadata (title, genre, rating, synopsis)
- Trailers or short video clips
- Information about official streaming platforms

There is **no free and legal public API** that:
- Provides **full-length movie streaming**
- Allows unrestricted use for third-party applications
- Complies with copyright and licensing regulations

### ⚖️ Legal Considerations
Streaming full movies without proper authorization violates:
- Copyright laws
- Content licensing agreements
- API terms of service

For these reasons, the project was **terminated** to avoid legal and ethical issues.

### ✅ Key Takeaways
Although the project could not be completed, it provided valuable learning outcomes:
- Researching and evaluating public APIs
- Understanding copyright and licensing constraints
- Designing applications within legal boundaries

### 🔄 Future Alternatives
This project may be reimagined as:
- A **movie catalog** application (no streaming)
- A **movie recommendation system** based on IMDb/TMDB ratings
- A discovery platform that redirects users to **official streaming services**
